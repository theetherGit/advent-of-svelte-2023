# Advent of Svelte 2023

This year's advent of code for me is `Advent of Svelte` by `svelte` team and `svelte society`.

> I'm trying to make it as a real world application, so file management and UI are important. Some things might don't 
make sense as I might be doing some things in a complex way.
